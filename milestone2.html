    <h2> Task & Problem Defininition</h2>
    <h3> Problem </h3>
    <p>Our problem relates to the transition from online/asynchronous/zoom classes back to in-person/synchronous classes. We will be focusing on the problem of participating and asking questions in an in-person lecture/class format. When on Zoom, it is easy
        for students to ask questions in the chat. The chat feature is a button on zoom, which we could refer to as a property. It signifies typing some kind of message, and in the classroom context it affords participating, encouraging students to speak
        up, ask questions, and even answer their classmates' questions. This avoids interrupting the professor, as well as provides a way for students who are more shy/anxious to speak up when they are confused. </p>
    <p> There are two sides of the problem of students asking questions in class. First we have students who do not want to ask questions, for reasons such as fear of public speaking, fear of having a bad question, or not wanting to interrupt the professor.
        If students do not ask questions, they will fall behind and continue to be confused. On the other hand, if a student does ask a question, we can still run into problems. Sometimes while a professor is lecturing, a student is unable to formulate
        their question until the professor has moved on to the next topic. If the student does decide to ask a question, the professor then has to go back to the previous topic, interrupting the flow of the lecture, potentially causing more confusion
        to other students. </p>
    <p> The problem of participating in an in-person class relates to the theme of in-person learning, since we are addressing a problem only existing in the classroom setting. </p>
    <p> In order to determine if this is a typical interaction, we did some research (sources cited below).</p>
    <p> Students are less likely to speak up in large lecture classes to ask questions when they have a fear of public speaking, which is considered an anxiety-generating factor that leads to fear and has a negative impact on personal and academic achievement”
        (Ferreira). In a 2016 study done at Federal University of Minas Gerais, Brazil, 63.9% of the 1135 college students across 70 different undergrad majors reported fear of public speaking”(Ferreira). </p>
    <p> An article from KQED states that a teacher noticed her students “were afraid to ask questions for fear of being wrong”(Schwartz) There must be a way for students who are scared of public speaking or scared of being wrong to overcome this social reticence
        in an in-person classroom. </p>
    <h4>Seven Stages of Action</h4>
    <h5> Trigger </h5>
    <p> Dr. Cotterell goes over an example of how to change text styles in Figma, but John can not seem to find out how to use a different font. </p>
    <h5> Goal </h5>
    <p> John wants to learn to use Figma, specifically how to change the font style, and do well in HCI.</p>
    <h5> Plan </h5>
    <p> John considers his options, one is to try and figure out how to change the font on his own and the other is to ask Dr. Cotterell a question on how to execute changing the font.</p>
    <h5>Specify </h5>
    <p> John has a fear of public speaking, and he does not want Dr. Cotterell or the other students think he is asking a bad question. Therefore, he decides not to ask for help. </p>
    <h5> Perform </h5>
    <p> John does not raise his hand, and instead continues to look at Figma on his laptop to see if he can find a way to change the font. </p>
    <h5> Perceive </h5>
    <p> John begins to get frustrated by his inability to change the font in Figma. He starts to squint at his laptop and furrow his brow in annoyance. </p>
    <h5> Interpret </h5>
    <p> John thinks to himself that taking HCI was a mistake, and that if he is not smart enough to figure out how to do something as basic as change the font, he will never be able to be successful. He is too caught up to pay attention to the rest of Dr.
        Cotterell’s lecture. </p>
    <h5> Compare </h5>
    <p> Since John did not ask his question and then was too distracted trying to find a solution that he missed the rest of Dr. Cotterell's lecture, he is now even more confused. He can not figure out how to add different screens or components to his Figma,
        and he has still not solved his original question of changing the font. Therefore, John has not met his goal. </p>
