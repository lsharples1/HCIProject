    <h2> Task & Problem Defininition</h2>
    <h3> Problem </h3>
    <p>Our problem relates to the transition from online/asynchronous/zoom classes back to in-person/synchronous classes. We will be focusing on the problem of participating and asking questions in an in-person lecture/class format. When on Zoom, it is easy
        for students to ask questions in the chat. The chat feature is a button on zoom, which we could refer to as a property. It signifies typing some kind of message, and in the classroom context it affords participating, encouraging students to speak
        up, ask questions, and even answer their classmates' questions. This avoids interrupting the professor, as well as provides a way for students who are more shy/anxious to speak up when they are confused. </p>
    <p> There are two sides of the problem of students asking questions in class. First we have students who do not want to ask questions, for reasons such as fear of public speaking, fear of having a bad question, or not wanting to interrupt the professor.
        If students do not ask questions, they will fall behind and continue to be confused. On the other hand, if a student does ask a question, we can still run into problems. Sometimes while a professor is lecturing, a student is unable to formulate
        their question until the professor has moved on to the next topic. If the student does decide to ask a question, the professor then has to go back to the previous topic, interrupting the flow of the lecture, potentially causing more confusion
        to other students. </p>
    <p> The problem of participating in an in-person class relates to the theme of in-person learning, since we are addressing a problem only existing in the classroom setting. </p>
    <p> In order to determine if this is a typical interaction, we did some research (sources cited below).</p>
    <p> Students are less likely to speak up in large lecture classes to ask questions when they have a fear of public speaking, which is considered an anxiety-generating factor that leads to fear and has a negative impact on personal and academic achievement”
        (Ferreira). In a 2016 study done at Federal University of Minas Gerais, Brazil, 63.9% of the 1135 college students across 70 different undergrad majors reported fear of public speaking”(Ferreira). </p>
    <p> An article from KQED states that a teacher noticed her students “were afraid to ask questions for fear of being wrong”(Schwartz) There must be a way for students who are scared of public speaking or scared of being wrong to overcome this social reticence
        in an in-person classroom. </p>
    <h4>Seven Stages of Action</h4>
    <h5> Trigger </h5>
    <p> Dr. Cotterell goes over an example of how to change text styles in Figma, but John can not seem to find out how to use a different font. </p>
    <h5> Goal </h5>
    <p> John wants to learn to use Figma, specifically how to change the font style, and do well in HCI.</p>
    <h5> Plan </h5>
    <p> John considers his options, one is to try and figure out how to change the font on his own and the other is to ask Dr. Cotterell a question on how to execute changing the font.</p>
    <h5>Specify </h5>
    <p> John has a fear of public speaking, and he does not want Dr. Cotterell or the other students think he is asking a bad question. Therefore, he decides not to ask for help. </p>
    <h5> Perform </h5>
    <p> John does not raise his hand, and instead continues to look at Figma on his laptop to see if he can find a way to change the font. </p>
    <h5> Perceive </h5>
    <p> John begins to get frustrated by his inability to change the font in Figma. He starts to squint at his laptop and furrow his brow in annoyance. </p>
    <h5> Interpret </h5>
    <p> John thinks to himself that taking HCI was a mistake, and that if he is not smart enough to figure out how to do something as basic as change the font, he will never be able to be successful. He is too caught up to pay attention to the rest of Dr.
        Cotterell’s lecture. </p>
    <h5> Compare </h5>
    <p> Since John did not ask his question and then was too distracted trying to find a solution that he missed the rest of Dr. Cotterell's lecture, he is now even more confused. He can not figure out how to add different screens or components to his Figma,
        and he has still not solved his original question of changing the font. Therefore, John has not met his goal. </p> <br>

    <h3> Potential Users </h3> <br>
    <pr> Our user population would primarily be students and instructors. Since our primary focus is on problems seeded by asynchronous learning in the classroom, students and instructors are naturally the affected users. Instructors routinely teach new material
        to students. Students must take notes on this information, and make sense of it, either by themselves, or with the help of others.Students may ask the instructor for clarification, but some may be dissuaded due to anxiety or shyness. Both students
        and instructors would benefit from a way to foster stronger communication between the student and the instructor. If a student has a question that another student can answer, an instructor wouldn’t need to pause their lecture, while the student
        benefits from other classmates. If a student feels comfortable asking a question to an instructor, the student gets their question answered, and the instructor will be able to discern which areas students are more confused about. Furthermore,
        the instructor could potentially use this information to modify their current lesson plans and lectures for future use. </pr> <br>

    <h2> Analysis of Existing Solutions</h2>
    <h3> Existing Solutions </h3>
    <p> There are a multitude of existing solutions or services that attempt to solve the problem that we have identified, however, each existing solution only touches on a part of our problem. None of them solve it holistically. </p>
    <p> The first is still using zoom, but during in person class. Students could still ask questions in the chat, and those questions could be seen and answered by other students or the professor. However, this is inefficient for the professor and is rarely
        if ever used currently. </p>
    <p> The main existing solution is TopHat. TopHat has a wide range of features and abilities including: checking attendance, polls and quizzes, in-class discussions, digital textbooks, learning insights, labs, as well as accessibility features. However,
        even with all of these useful features, it still does not allow students to ask questions during class. The only interfaces available to students are the slides that the professor is presenting, and any in-class questions that the professor has
        posted. In addition, TopHat costs money. It’s not even that each professor has to pay for it, every single student has to pay for a subscription for the class for the semester. </p>
    <p> Other alternatives include: Canvas LMS (costs money), Webex (cost money), Adobe Connect (costs money), Google Classroom, etc. However, none of these options offer students the ability to ask the professor questions live during class.</p> <br>
    <h3> Potential Guidelines and Solutions </h3> <br>
    <p> As previously mentioned, the most widely used currently existing platform is TopHat. According to their website, “TopHat is designed to meet or exceed the internationally recognized Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA and Section
        508 standards in the United States. Our platform is compatible with screen readers and offers keyboard navigation, making learning equitable for everyone. Students can learn anytime, anywhere, including using Top Hat in offline mode to complete
        work—no need for an Internet connection. You can also accommodate individual students or groups by providing flexible options for assignments, tests and grading.” </p>
    <p> Zoom is also compliant with section 508 standards. </p>
    <p> The guidelines and principles that appropriately serve our users are of course the section 508 standards that procure, create, use and maintain ICT that is accessible to people with disabilities. </p>
    <p> In addition, we will prioritize accommodating students with anxiety by allowing our chat feature and questions to be anonymous. Even over zoom, some students are too shy or anxious to ask questions, as their name is still attached to what they ask.
        While students will still have the option to ask questions with their name attached, by allowing students to ask questions anonymously, we take away a potential additional layer of stress from students, and allow even more students to ask questions.
    </p> <br>

    <h2> Proposed Solution</h2>
    <h3> Our Solution </h3>
    <p>Our team proposes an application which integrates the positive aspects of asynchronous learning into a synchronous learning environment. Specifically, we plan to draw inspiration from the chat feature in Zoom, so students are able to ask questions
        during a lecture, without having to speak up or interrupt the flow of class. The properties of our application will be simple, and the signifiers will clearly communicate the appropriate behavior to the user. Our app will have properties such
        as a live chat feed and anonymous name settings. Participants (AKA students) will be able to anonymously post questions to the chat feed throughout the duration of the class. The host (AKA the instructor) will be able to view the feed and respond
        to/ask questions in the feed. The signifiers will include a text box and a “send” button. The text box signifies typing a question, and the “send” button signifies posting your question/response to the feed. Together, these signifiers afford asking
        questions and participating. </p><br>
    <p> Our proposed solution draws inspiration from existing solutions, such as the Zoom chat box feature. The Zoom chat feature allows participants to post questions to a chat feed, however, the user must choose between posting the question publicly, to
        all participants, or privately, to the host or their chosen participant. Either way, anonymity is not maintained. Our solution will incorporate this chat feature, but allow users to post their questions anonymously. This will further encourage
        students to ask questions and participate in class, as it eliminates the fear associated with “asking a stupid question.” The simplicity of our solution will also contribute to its ease-of-use, compared to Zoom, which has many different features
        alongside its primary video call feature. </p> <br>
    <h3> How to Measure Success </h3> <br>
    <p>
        Design success will be dependent upon if students ask more questions while using the application, compared to without the application. This criteria can be used to evaluate whether or not our design enhances synchronous learning, as getting more questions
        answered helps a student understand the material more deeply. Students will leave the lecture with no further questions about the material, and therefore, a stronger foundation. Our design success can also be judged based on a student being more
        inclined to ask a question using our application, than without it. Other criteria include increased class participation, student confidence in class material, and instructor confidence in student understanding of class material. Failure to meet
        any of the criteria discussed above would indicate a design fail.</p> <br>
