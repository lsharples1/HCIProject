    <h3> Summary: </h3>
    <p> We are focusing on the problem of students participating and asking questions in an in-person class/lecture format. When on Zoom, it was easy for students to ask questions in the chat, encouraging students to speak up, ask questions, and even answer
        their classmates' questions. Now that students are in person for lectures, this solution no longer exists and students have to go back to raising their hand and asking questions in lectures. For those with a fear of public speaking, avoiding speaking
        up to ask questions can result in confusion and a lack of understanding of the content being taught.</p> <br>
