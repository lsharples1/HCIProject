    <h3> Most Relevant User Stories: </h3> 
    <p> Out of the 8 user stories we generated, we found 2 of them to be most relevant. Those 2 are ranked by relevance below.</p> 
    <h4>1. As a student with a fear of public speaking or anxiety, I want to ask questions anonymously without having to speak up during a lecture.</h4>
    <p>Justification: According to a study done by Dr. Anna Carolina Ferreira 
        Marinho, which aimed to determine the prevalence of fear of public speaking among college students, “63.9% of the sampled students reported a fear of public speaking” [1]. Furthermore, journalist Katrina Schwartz shares stories about a teacher “who noticed her students were afraid to ask questions for fear of being wrong” [2]. Based on the evidence we gathered and our own personal experiences as college students, we concluded that the fear of public speaking is negatively affecting students across many classrooms. Due to a “fear of being wrong,” students are less included to speak up and ask questions when they are confused. If a student is unable to get their questions answered, then this confusion continues to build and ultimately leads to their poor performance in a class. To prevent the embarrassment and anxiety associated with public speaking, a level of anonymity can be introduced to separate the student from their question. This level of anonymity, offered within our proposed solution, will allow students to ask questions without needing to speak up.</p>
    <h4> 2. As an instructor, I want to be aware of my students' understanding of the current topic so that I know when to move on to the next topic.    </h4>
    <p> Justification: In a study from the Carnegie Mellon University Language Technologies Institute, researchers observed how students get confused in courses, specifically online courses. Within the research, they observed that “without receiving help from other students or teaching staff, students might remain confused. Persistent confusion might promote low self-efficacy… negative attitudes toward the course and ultimately lead to dropout”[9]. In order to address the issue of confusion in classes, “instructors’ ability to monitor confusion from behavioral traces could be leveraged to offer just-in-time support for confused students, and this support might increase the overall course success”[9]. Within our designs, we focus on the idea that offering support to students when they first get confused is the best time. If students wait too long to get help, there is a higher chance of remaining confused. </p>
        
    
    <h2> Ideation and Preliminary Designs</h2> 
    <h4> User Story 1 Top Picks</h4>
    <p> 1. An app that allow students to post their questions to a live chat feed that the instructor and other classmates can view and respond to during the class period.</p>
    <p> 2. An app with a feature that allows students to toggle between anonymous and not anonymous when asking questions to the instructor, in real-time.</p>
    <img src = "images/jamboard1.png">

    <h4> User Story 2 Top Picks</h4>
    <p> 1. Voting feature (upvote/downvote) on students' questions so the professor can see which questions students need answered the most. questions are displayed by most-to-least upvoted.</p>
    <p> 2. Professor can see the percentage/graph representation of students who are ready to move on and those who are still confused on the current topic (1-10 scale).</p>
