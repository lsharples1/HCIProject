    <h2> High-Fidelity Prototypes</h2>
    <h3> User Story 1 Prototype </h3>
    <p> As a student with a fear of public speaking or anxiety, I want to ask questions anonymously without having to speak up during a lecture.</p>

      <h3> User Story 2 Prototype </h3>
      <p>As an instructor, I want to be aware of my students' understanding of the current topic so that I know when to move on to the next topic.</p>

    <h2> Testing Protocol</h2> 
    <h4> Research Question:</h4>
  <p>Does the addition of asking anonymous questions and real time answering capabilities improve the flow of lectures and overall learning of students?</p>
  <h4> Testing Methodology:</h4>
  <p> We will use a mixed methodology for testing. Our team plans to combine 
    observation, surveys, and experiments in order to gain a thorough 
    understanding of how our application affects synchronous learning. We will first utilize an experimental approach by taking random samples of classes across our university campus. These classes will then be randomly assigned to a control group or a treatment group. The treatment group will use our application during one month in the middle of the semester, whereas the control group will continue their class as normal. This experimental approach will reduce bias in our study. Our team will also use surveys for testing. A survey will be given at the beginning and end of the study, in order to compare data before and after the study period. The survey will be administered to both the treatment and control group, as well as to both students and professors. The student survey will contain questions related to confidence in class material and confidence in asking questions. Our team hypothesizes that the control group’s confidence would remain the same, and that the treatment group’s confidence would increase with the inclusion of our application. The instructor surveys will contain questions related to confidence in student understanding of class material, confidence that students are asking all questions they may have, and how often class was interrupted due to students asking questions (i.e. not at the beginning or end of a class, nor when the instructor specifically asks for questions). This method will provide us with ground truth data. Lastly, our team plans to incorporate participant observation into our study in order to keep track of the number of questions asked in the control and treatment groups. This metric can be used to evaluate whether or not our synchronous learning is enhanced, as getting more questions answered helps a student understand the material more clearly. Together, the experiment, survey, and participant observation method will contribute to thorough testing.	</p>
    <h2> Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p> In order to deal with informed consent, before the experiment, we plan on going to the classrooms of the experiment groups and explain to the students what the product is, how the experiment will be run, give a demo on the product, and ask if anyone has any questions or concerns. They can then ask questions, voice concerns, or opt out if they do not want to participate. Their grades will be used anonymously. Every student/professor must sign a waiver before the experiment actually starts.

      In terms of data collection, for both the experiment and control groups, we will be collecting the number of questions students ask in the class with or without the product. Student grades throughout the course of the experiment. </p>
  <h4> Informed Consent</h4>
  <p> For experiment group: Before starting the experiment, go to the classroom and explain to the students what the product is, how the experiment will be run, give a demo on the product, and ask if any has questions or concerns. They can then ask questions, opt out if they do not want to participate, their grades will be used but be anonymous. Every student/professor must sign a waiver before the experiment actually starts.</p>
  <p> For control group: explain that they are part of a study but nothing will change for them, however their class data will be observed and used, their grades will be used but be anonymous.  Every student/professor must sign a waiver before the experiment actually starts.</p>    
  <h4> Data Collection</h4>
  <p> For both groups: Collect the # of questions students ask questions in the class with or without the product. Student grades throughout the course of the experiment. As researchers observe, they would keep track of how many questions are asked in the control and experimental group. Ask survey at beginning and end and compare. </p>
  <p> For experiment group: how many of these questions are asked with the anonymous feature. How many times the professor uses the ‘answer question in class feature’.</p>
  <h4>Analysis</h4>
  <p>More questions being answered would indicate increased understanding of lecture material, and would hopefully correlate with higher grades. We assume that the experiment group will have higher # of questions asked and higher grades.</p>
  <h4>Pandemic Safety Concerns</h4>
  <p>Researcher will wear a mask and sit in the back corner of classroom, as part of the informed consent participants will be aware of this and sign off that it is ok.</p>
