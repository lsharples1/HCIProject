## Milestone 1- Proposal
After the last ~2 years of online and/or asynchronous learning, students are having a tough time readjusting to in-person classes. We will be focusing on the problem of participating and asking questions in an in-person lecture/class format. When on Zoom, it is easy for students to ask questions in the chat. This avoids interrupting the professor, as well as provides a way for students who are more shy/anxious to speak up when they are confused.
With the example of a class on Zoom, the chat feature affords participating, encouraging students to speak up, ask questions, and even answer their classmates' questions. Certain in-person classroom compositions (large lecture halls) contribute to this problem, especially affecting students who are shy and do not want to ask questions in front of a large group. This prevents them from getting clarification, causing them to become more confused and less likely to ask for help.
This problem affects both students and professors. Sometimes while a professor is lecturing, a student is unable to formulate their question until the professor has moved on to the next topic. If the student does decide to ask a question, the professor then has to go back to the previous topic, interrupting the flow of the lecture, potentially causing more confusion. However, if the student does not want to interrupt to ask a question, they will still be confused. In either situation, there is a negative outcome. Furthermore, this problem affects all students, but especially those with anxiety, those who are shy, and those who are simply afraid of public speaking. Our team will propose a solution to these problems that encourages class participation and alleviates the stress and anxiety that is oftentimes accompanied with asking questions and participating in class.
